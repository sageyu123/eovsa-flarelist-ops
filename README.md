# EOVSA Flarelist Operations (`eovsa-flarelist-ops`)

The `eovsa-flarelist-ops` repository is for the maintenance and data enrichment of the [EOVSA Flarelist website](http://www.ovsa.njit.edu/flarelist). It comprises essential scripts for updating the MySQL database with the latest solar flare observations by EOVSA and for generating spectrogram data and figures. This repository functions as a submodule within the broader [EOVSA Flarelist main repository](https://github.com/ovro-eovsa/eovsa-flarelist), ensuring the flare list remains up-to-date with recent observations.

## Prerequisites

To utilize the scripts in this repository effectively, you should have Python installed on your system along with several key dependencies. The exact requirements might differ based on your specific setup and the scripts you intend to use, but generally, you'll need:

- MySQL connectors for database operations.
- Data processing and visualization libraries, such as NumPy and Matplotlib.

**Environment Setup:** The scripts are currently deployed on the `OVSA` server, accessible under the `sjyu` account. To begin working with the scripts, log in to the server (`sjyu@ovsa`), and attach to the pre-existing screen session dedicated to flare list updates:

```bash
screen -rd flarelist
```

**Repository Update:** To guarantee you are utilizing the most current iteration of the `eovsa-flarelist-ops` repository, make sure it aligns with the upstream repository at [https://github.com/ovro-eovsa/eovsa-flarelist-ops.git](https://github.com/ovro-eovsa/eovsa-flarelist-ops.git). The repository is also mirrored at [https://github.com/sageyu123/eovsa-flarelist-ops.git](https://github.com/sageyu123/eovsa-flarelist-ops.git), serving as the origin. For the latest updates, you may choose to sync directly with the upstream or adjust the origin accordingly. To proceed with updating, follow these steps:

```bash
cd $HOME/eovsa-flarelist-ops
sudo git fetch upstream
sudo git merge upstream/main
```

## Usage

Manual updates to the MySQL database might be necessary at times. To access the MySQL console on the OVSA server with the relevant credentials, use:

```bash
mysql -h"${FLARE_DB_HOST}" -u"${FLARE_DB_USER}" -p"${FLARE_DB_PASSWORD}"
```

**Setting Permissions:** Before running the `run_flarelist2sql.sh` script, switch to the `user` group to ensure you have the appropriate file access permissions:

```bash
newgrp user
```

**Script Execution:** Execute the script with the following syntax, providing optional arguments as needed:

```bash
./run_flarelist2sql.sh -t "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS"
```

Options include:
- `-t` or `--timerange` to define the time range for fetching and processing flare data.
- `--do_manu` for manual adjustments of the start/end times for radio bursts.
- `-h` or `--help` to show this help message and exit.

A cronbjob is set up to run the script every 6 hours, with logs written to `$HOME/flarelist_update.log`.
```crontab
0 */6 * * * /bin/bash -c 'cd /home/sjyu/eovsa-flarelist-ops && ./run_flarelist2sql.sh -t "$(date -d "2 days ago" "+\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S")" "$(date "+\%Y-\%m-\%d \%H:\%M:\%S")"' >> $HOME/flarelist_update.log 2>&1
```
Note: cron requires escaping `%` as `\\%`. Depending on how the command is invoked, those backslashes can survive into the expanded `date` output; `flarelist2sql.py` strips them before parsing.
